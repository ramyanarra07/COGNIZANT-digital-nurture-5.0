# 95. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS CODE COMMENT DISCUSSIONS:
# 
# How the OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow differs from Simple JWT Login:
#
# 1. Simple JWT Login (Our current implementation):
#    - The client app collects user credentials (email/password) directly via a form.
#    - The client sends them straight to the resource API backend server.
#    - The backend matches them and directly issues a signed JWT token access envelope.
#    - Best used for internal, first-party trust systems (like your company's own app).
#
# 2. OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow:
#    - Built specifically for third-party client integrations without exposing credentials.
#    - The client redirects the user to an external Authorization Server (e.g., Log in with Google).
#    - The user authenticates there, and that server issues a temporary authorization code back to the client.
#    - The client backend exchanges that short-lived code securely for an access token.
#    - Key Value: The third-party app handles the resource token but never sees or handles the user's password.
